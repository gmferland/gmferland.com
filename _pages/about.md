I believe moving "slow" actually helps teams move faster. By investing time in proper code review and documentation, we avoid wasting time later on fixing bugs or explaining the same things repeatedly. When given proper tooling and processes, developers are more self-sufficient and can write higher quality code more quickly, without having to worry about breaking an application.

I try to bring this to every team I work with. Don’t get me wrong, I love to code–I’m a full stack developer–but I’m only one person. Products aren’t built by individuals. I enjoy sharing knowledge with teammates and clients, not only to help them work better, but to challenge myself and learn new skills from them.

Code review is a functional place to both enforce quality work and teach others. At startups, it might be the only opportunity for knowledge sharing in a fast paced environment. When done wrong, code review is an impediment to a team's velocity and can make people feel inferior. When done right, it can reinforce trust and responsibility among team members and breeds collective ownership of a project.
