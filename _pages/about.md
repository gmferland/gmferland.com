* I am a full stack developer
* I enjoy the challenge of learning new things
* Sharing that knowledge with others is a rewarding experience
* I believe moving "slow" actually makes you move faster. By investing time in proper code review and documentation, we avoid wasting time later on fixing bugs or explaining the same things over and over again. When given the proper tools and processes, developers are more self sufficient and can write better code faster without having to worry about breaking an application. 
* I care about code review because it can be the only opportunity for knowledge sharing in a fast paced environment. When done wrong, code review is an impediment to a team's velocity and can make people feel inferior. When done right, it can reinforce trust and responsibility among team members and breeds collective ownership of a project.
* I care about documentation because a few lines of code or a task that makes perfect sense to you after you've spent hours immersed in it will not seem so simple to your coworkers, or even your future self
* I also like to run and ski and do crossword puzzles
